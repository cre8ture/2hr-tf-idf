            <div class="info"> <code> TF-IDF, short for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, is a numerical statistic used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It's a product of two statistics: term frequency and inverse document frequency. Term frequency measures how frequently a term occurs in a document, while inverse document frequency diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely. Therefore, TF-IDF helps to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general and provides a way to assess the importance of words in a document relative to the entire corpus.</code></div>
